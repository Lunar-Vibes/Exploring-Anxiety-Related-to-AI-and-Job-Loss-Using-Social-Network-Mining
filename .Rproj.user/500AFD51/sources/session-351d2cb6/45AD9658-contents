# Exercises

# Exercise 1.1
# Import quotations for any asset of your choice using either provided files or 
# quantmod package from first labs. Then calculate logarithmic returns on that 
# asset and compare Value-at-Risk estimates for 2021 from historical simulation,
# GARCH models and filtered historical simulation (models should be built on the 
# data prior to 01-01-2021 with moving window method). Does the quality of the 
# models change? Are some approaches much better than the others? What caused 
# such behavior? Plot the VaR estimates together with data.

# Exercise 1.2
# Load the data for the credit risk applications. Run necessary preprocessing 
# steps. Train logistic regression, random forest and xgboost models. Compare 
# the models performance for AUC. Are the ML models better or worse than logistic 
# regression? Choose a probability of default threshold level for one of the 
# models and justify your selection.
